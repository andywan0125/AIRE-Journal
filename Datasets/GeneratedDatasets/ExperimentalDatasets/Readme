This repository includes all 28 experimental datasets used in the paper [1,2].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a. All datasets are with the form of 'txt' file. 

b. The 1st row is the Entrez ID for all genes;

c. From the 2nd row, each GO term and its genes' annotation values are included, segmented by ',';

d. In the last row, each gene's class attribute value is included, segmented by ','.
